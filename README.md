-How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-What design process did you follow for your project work?
-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
When designing software—especially in a graphics context like C++ with OpenGL—I start by defining the purpose of the application and identifying key components such as input handling, rendering logic, and user interaction.For a 3D scene, this might mean planning out how the scene graph will be structured and how shaders, textures, and objects will be managed.
This project helped me develop skills in scene design and spatial reasoning, particularly how to organize and manage 3D assets efficiently
1.Planning – outlining the core features (e.g., object rendering, camera movement, lighting)
2.Structuring – defining classes like Mesh, Shader, Camera, and Scene
3.Prototyping – implementing basic rendering with minimal shaders
4.Refinement – adding lighting, textures, transformations, and user controls
5.Testing and iteration – adjusting design based on performance and visual feedback
The modular design tactics I used—separating rendering, input, and logic—can be applied to any future C++ project. Planning for flexibility (like abstracting shader loading or input systems) helps in expanding or reusing components. Keeping design loosely coupled makes it easier to scale or adapt the project for different use cases (e.g., VR, more complex games, or engines).

-How do I approach developing programs?
-How did iteration factor into your development?
-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
With C++ and OpenGL, I take a layered approach—starting with foundational systems like windowing (e.g., using GLFW), OpenGL context setup, and then moving to rendering pipeline configuration. I develop incrementally, focusing on getting one component functional before moving to the next. Iteration was crucial. My initial builds had only basic shape rendering and a static camera. Through testing and feedback, I iteratively added features like camera controls, ambient and directional lighting, object transformations, and texture mapping. Each iteration improved the user experience and brought the scene closer to the intended design. Iteration also helped me discover and fix performance bottlenecks early. I started creating utility classes for loading models, handling shaders, and managing input. I also adopted better debugging practices and consistent documentation. By the end of the project, my code was much more organized and easier to extend, reflecting a stronger understanding of both C++ principles and real-time graphics development.

Computer Science has been a crazy ride and will help me continue to gain knowlege to helpme further my career with computers. I currently work from home and this degree will help me step up into an engineering role within that company. I do not have any further schooling plans after this degree but will forever be learning new things through my life experiences. Taking this class has been an eye opening experience for me, I was starting to lose hope with all the different coding languages and not liking any of them. Graphics may end up being a direction I end up trying to go in.
